* beer-me

Beer Me is a utility designed to quickly answer questions commonly brought forth in an on-call situation.

#+begin_src bash
  # example usage:
  beer-me order --id='<some uuid>' # get an order by id

  beer-me order number=25436      # getting an order by number

  beer-me batches item-code='ABSDF523452' # getting all the batches for a given item by code

                # +------note the custom query arguments of the form [direction]-[num]-[unit]
                # |      these identifiers should be generated for some cartesian product
                # v      of time-based options
  beer-me users last-two-days     # getting all users created/added in the last two days

  beer-me missing order number=(23456 546789 3245345) # Find any absent orders from the given list

  beer-me headless user email='please@help.me' # Find all info usually returned with the USER,
                                               # after USER has been deleted. (essentially cleaning up a missing CASCADE)
#+end_src

The idea is that the beer-me language is essentially a tree of commands.
The root node is the utility itself, =beer-me=. Connected to this is (sometimes) an AUGMENTATION, followed by one or more RESOURCES.
** Augmentations
These consist of =missing= and =headless=.

** Resources
- order
- product
- batches <-- special plural case
- user

  Tree like structure
  e.g. item ==> batches --> batch code, name, expiration date
  /all leaves are filters/, regardless of how high up the tree they are

*** Filters
